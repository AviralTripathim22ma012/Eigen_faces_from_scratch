Welcome to the EigenFaces Implementation repository! This repository contains an implementation of EigenFaces using Python, presented as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

EigenFaces is a popular facial recognition technique used in computer vision. It's based on the principal component analysis (PCA) technique and is widely employed in various applications like face recognition, biometrics, and image compression.

This repository provides an in-depth implementation of EigenFaces from scratch, allowing you to understand the underlying concepts and algorithms involved.

## Implementation Details

The implementation covers the following key aspects:

- Preprocessing of facial images
- Computing the eigenfaces
- Projecting faces onto the eigenfaces subspace
- Recognizing faces using nearest neighbor classification

## Usage

To explore the implementation, simply open the `EigenFaces_Implementation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Follow along with the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to understand how EigenFaces works and how to apply it for facial recognition tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Acknowledgments

This implementation is inspired by the seminal work on EigenFaces in computer vision literature. Special thanks to the contributors and maintainers of libraries used in this project.
